# JailBreakDetection
For security reasons, we need to check if our iOS app (like banking apps, OTT apps, etc) is running on a jailbroken phone or not. Most people suggest, check if "Cydia" is installed or not. But there might be some chances that the device doesn't have "Cydia" installed or installed with an alternative name. This is the most effective way to check it.
